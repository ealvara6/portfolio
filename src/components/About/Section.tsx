        Hey there! I&apos;m Eduardo Alvarado. I am an aspiring web developer looking to step
        my foot into the world of web development. I am an Alum from the University of Houston and
        I graduated from the C.T Bauer College of Bussiness with a bachelors degree in
        Management Information Systems in the fall of 2020.

        I am currently taking courses from the Odin Project (a community driven curriculum)
        which is teaching me fullstack web development with emphasis on React and Node.
        I have coded multiple projects to try and solidify my skills in web development and
        I hope that I can show that I am a hard working individual determined to start my
        career as a web developer.
